# IoT-Security
Project simulation exercise#1
## 📌 Overview
This project simulates an IoT device sending encrypted data over an MQTT network to prevent attackers from intercepting sensitive information. 

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **AES Encryption (PyCryptodome)**
- **MQTT Protocol (paho-mqtt)**
- **Mosquitto MQTT Broker**

## 📜 Features
✅ Simulates an IoT sensor sending real-time data.  
✅ Implements **AES encryption** for secure communication.  
✅ Demonstrates an **attacker intercepting data**.  
✅ Shows how encryption prevents unauthorized access.  

## 🛠️ Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```sh
   pip install paho-mqtt pycryptodome
